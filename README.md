# Where To

Where To is an application designed to plan trips for users, and manage trip bookings by travel agents. Users can log in with their unique ID and password, choose a destination, trip duration, and amount of travelers before submitting a request to an agent, who can approve/deny requests. All data is fetched from multiple API's for both type of users, and posted as well.
